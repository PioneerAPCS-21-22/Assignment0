# Assignment0

For this assignment you will write a short Java program that will output your initials (if you don't have three initials, use the first three letters of your first or last name). The height should be at least 7 lines. An example of mine is below.


        C C C C         J J J J J J J     K       K
      C         C             J           K     K
    C                         J           K   K
    C                         J           K K
    C                         J           K   K
      C         C       J     J           K     K
        C C C C          J J J            K       K


Download the `Main.java` file from Github or paste the code into a new class file to get started.

* Use the `System.out.print` and/or `System.out.println` statements to output the letters.
* Update the comments at the top of the file with your name and the date.
* Remember to use consistent styling (brace placement, spaces, returns, etc.).
